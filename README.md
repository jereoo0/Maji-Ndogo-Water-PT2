## **Overview**  
Maji Ndogo, a country in **Sub-Saharan Africa**, has been struggling with **limited access to baisc water**. To address this issue, the newly elected government launched an **8-year water restoration project** based on insights from a national survey.  

This report provides a **progress update** on the **Maji Ndogo Water Project**, tracking **budget utilization, infrastructure improvements, vendor performance, and overall impact** on water accessibility.  

---

## **Objective**  
This report aims to **track the progress** of the **Maji Ndogo Water Restoration Project**, focusing on:  
- **Percentage completion of the project**  
- **Improvements made across provinces and towns**  
- **Budget allocation and cost tracking**  
- **Vendor performance and cost-effectiveness**  

The accompanying **interactive dashboard** provides **real-time insights** into these metrics, allowing government stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## **Key Findings and Insights**  
- **Project Progress:**  
  - **22% of the project is complete**, benefiting **3,944,126 people** with improved access to basic water.  
  - **Basic water access has increased from 34% to 48%**, marking a **14% improvement**.  

- **Budget Utilization:**  
  - The project is currently **10.69% over budget**, with a total **cumulative cost of $33.79M** against the planned **cumulative budget of $30.52M**.  
  - **Sokoto is the most over-budget province**, exceeding its allocated budget by **14.05%**.  

- **Cost Overruns & Spending Issues:**  
  - **All improvements have exceed their cumulative budgets**, causing financial strain.  
  - **Infrastructure repairs are 90.36% over budget**, yet only **4% of repairs are completed**.  
  - **Rural improvements cost nearly twice as much as urban projects**, despite receiving **50% more budget allocation**.  

- **Vendor Performance & Cost Efficiency:**  
  - Some vendors like **Meru Borehole Services (MBS605)** are expensive but **operates in difficult rural conditions**, justifying its costs.  
  - Other vendors like **Ouagadougou Waterworks (OW290)** appear to be **overcharging without strong justification**.

## **Recommendations**  

### **1. Optimize Budget Utilization**  
 **Negotiate better contracts** with vendors that show inflated pricing.  
 **Limit reliance on high-cost vendors**, unless justified by operational difficulties.  

### **2. Vendor Optimization**  
 **Review vendor performance metrics** (cost, progress, rural/urban location).  
 **Discontinue underperforming vendors** to save costs.  
 **Narrow down vendor selection** to a **few highly efficient providers** for **better cost consistency**.  

### **3. Improve Infrastructure Repair Efficiency**  
 **Increase focus on infrastructure repairs**, which are significantly over budget.  
 **Implement preventive maintenance programs** to reduce future repair costs.  
 **Monitor infrastructure upgrades** to ensure progress aligns with financial planning.  

### **4. Address Rural Cost Challenges**  
 **Introduce alternative water solutions** (rainwater harvesting, solar-powered filtration) to lower costs.  
 **Invest in community-led water management** for long-term cost reductions.  

### **5. Enhance Transparency & Public Engagement**  
 **Provide stakeholders with periodic reports** on spending, vendor performance, and project milestones.  
 **Increase accountability in budget allocation** to avoid inefficiencies.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
This report highlights **significant progress in expanding basic water access**, while also revealing **critical challenges in cost efficiency and budget management**. Although the project has already benefited millions, **vendor performance optimization, better financial oversight, and improved infrastructure planning** are necessary to ensure **long-term sustainability**.  

By implementing the **recommended cost-saving measures and strategic vendor management**, the project can **stay within budget while maximizing its impact on basic water accessibility** in Maji Ndogo.
